  'What is G54?': 'G54 is a work coordinate system (WCS) offset command in CNC machining. It tells the machine where your part zero (origin) is located relative to the machine\'s home position.\n\nThink of it like this: The machine has its own "home" position, but your part has its own "zero" point. G54 is the bridge between them.\n\nKey points:\n• G54 is the most commonly used work offset\n• You set it using the machine\'s offset page\n• It stores X, Y, and Z coordinates\n• Other offsets include G55, G56, G57, G58, G59\n\nExample:\nG54 G0 X0 Y0 Z0\n(This moves to your part zero using the G54 offset)',

  'How do I set tool offset?': 'Setting tool offsets is crucial for accurate machining. Here\'s the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Touch off the tool**: Jog the tool down until it just touches the top of your part or a gauge block\n\n2. **Record the Z position**: Note the current Z coordinate\n\n3. **Enter the offset**: Go to the Tool Offset page on your controller\n\n4. **Input the value**: Enter the Z height into the appropriate tool number slot\n\n5. **Verify**: Run a test cut to confirm accuracy\n\nPro tip: Use a gauge block of known height for more precision. If using a 1" block, your offset = Z position - 1.000\n\nOn Simply Technologies machines with the iCNC controller, you can access tool offsets through the "Offsets" button on the main screen.',

  'How do I start the spindle?': 'Starting the spindle requires both G-code commands and physical controls:\n\n**G-code Method:**\n• M3 S1000 - Start spindle clockwise at 1000 RPM\n• M4 S1000 - Start spindle counterclockwise at 1000 RPM\n• M5 - Stop spindle\n\n**Manual Method:**\n1. Ensure the emergency stop is released\n2. Press the spindle enable button\n3. Use the spindle speed override dial to set RPM\n4. Press the spindle start button (green)\n\n**Safety Reminders:**\n• Always wear safety glasses\n• Ensure the tool is properly secured\n• Check that the workpiece is clamped\n• Start at lower RPM and increase gradually\n• Never reach into the machine while spindle is running',

  'Why did the machine stop?': 'Machines can stop for several reasons. Here\'s a troubleshooting guide:\n\n**Common Causes:**\n\n1. **Emergency Stop Activated**\n   - Check if E-stop button is pressed\n   - Solution: Release E-stop and reset machine\n\n2. **Feed Hold Pressed**\n   - Operator may have paused the program\n   - Solution: Press Cycle Start to resume\n\n3. **M0 or M1 in Program**\n   - Programmed stop for inspection\n   - Solution: Press Cycle Start to continue\n\n4. **Limit Switch Triggered**\n   - Machine traveled too far\n   - Solution: Jog away from limit, re-home machine\n\n5. **Tool Change Required**\n   - M6 command in program\n   - Solution: Change tool and press Cycle Start\n\n6. **Alarm Condition**\n   - Check the alarm message on screen\n   - Common alarms: servo error, overload, door open\n\nAlways check the controller display for specific error messages!',

  'What does F mean in G-code?': 'F stands for **Feed Rate** - it controls how fast the cutting tool moves through the material.\n\n**Understanding Feed Rate:**\n\n• Measured in inches per minute (IPM) or millimeters per minute (mm/min)\n• Affects surface finish, tool life, and cycle time\n• Different for different materials and operations\n\n**Examples:**\nG1 X1.0 Y1.0 F10.0\n(Move to X1, Y1 at 10 inches per minute)\n\nG1 Z-0.5 F5.0\n(Plunge down 0.5" at 5 IPM - slower for drilling)\n\n**Feed Rate Guidelines:**\n• Aluminum: 40-100 IPM\n• Steel: 10-30 IPM\n• Plastic: 50-150 IPM\n• Wood: 100-300 IPM\n\n**Pro Tips:**\n• Start conservative and increase gradually\n• Roughing cuts: faster feeds\n• Finishing cuts: slower feeds for better surface\n• Listen to the machine - it will tell you if feed is wrong!'
